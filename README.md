| [Fantasy premier league "fantasies"](https://github.com/abimur-123/Fantasy_premierleague) | How does VIP hospitality for two 2019/2020 Premier League matches sound?  You stand a chance of winning that if you win the [Fantasy premier league competition](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/prizes). I am trying to use machine learning to give myself a better chance at winning the  coveted prize! | Aug 2018 | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg/200px-Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png) |
| [Game,set and who's match?](https://github.com/abimur-123/Tennis_prediction) | The hardest bit of predicting results for games is discounting for luck.  Luck probably has the least impact on the game of tennis and one can rely on talent to win the game, unlike other sports such as soccer where you are only as good as your team. Given the fact that we know luck plays minimal role in tennis can we predict the outcome of games based on player stats? | Jan 2018 | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg/200px-Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png) |
| [Mental health data exploration](https://github.com/abimur-123/Mentalhealth_project) | There is an increase in cases of mental illness on a global scale. Mental health problems are slowly becoming one of the top contributors to deaths across the world. Tech companies are rapidly growing in number and size and this means there is more pressure on their workers to perform. This pressure could have negative implications on a few individuals and before they realize could lead to mental illness. In this analysis, I look at mental health survey data of workers across the globe to determine if the tech companies are doing enough to ensure the mental well-being of their employees. | Dec 2017 | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png),![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5b211a0a8995a521765e786af420066dae36cbce/68747470733a2f2f7777772e7273747564696f2e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031342f30342f7368696e792e706e67), ![](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/vertical.png) ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg/200px-Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png)|
| [Blackbox](https://github.com/abimur-123/BlackBox_Python) | The Bayesian vs Frequentist approach is more of a philosophical debate which we will not delve into. This package attempts at breaking down the understanding and the underlying assumptions of the 2 approaches and how they compare. The package will run a significance analysis using both approaches based on data provided by the user, compare credible and confidence intervals. | Apr 2018 | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg/200px-Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png) ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png) |
| [Mind your language](https://github.com/abimur-123/mind-your-language) | This project explores how the first programming language that you learnt affects your preference  between R and Python (survey using Google forms) | Apr 2018 | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png)|
| [NHL exploration](https://github.com/abimur-123/NHL_exploration) | Explore data available from the National Hockey League API  | Mar 2018 |![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png) |
| [Git Busy](https://github.com/abimur-123/gitBusy) | The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly and intuitive API wrapper for Github. The gitBusy package allows users to efficiently retrieve information on organizations, users, and repositories from the Github website. | Apr 2018 | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/220px-R_logo.svg.png) |
